      <description>tags: Perl 5
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I could enjoy daily programming life with Perl 5.
I tried to find a chance to make any program with Perl, but it&amp;rsquo;s not easy especially when co-workers does not looks very happy reading the Perl code.
There are many languages showing off their fancy features and paradigm, like Kotlin and Haskell or even new projects on going with OpenJDK, however I believe perl is still a very powerful tool for any kind of utilization.</description>
